# What is MVP?
MVP pattern allows separate the presentation layer from the logic, so that everything about how the interface works is separated from how we represent it on screen. Ideally the MVP pattern would achieve that same logic might have completely different and interchangeable views.
First thing to clarify is that MVP is not an architectural pattern, itâ€™s only responsible for the presentation layer . In any case it is always better to use it for your architecture that not using it at all.

# Why use MVP?
n Android we have a problem arising from the fact that Android activities are closely coupled to both interface and data access mechanisms. We can find extreme examples such as CursorAdapter, which mix adapters, which are part of the view, with cursors, something that should be relegated to the depths of data access layer .
For an application to be easily extensible and maintainable we need to define well separated layers. What do we do tomorrow if, instead of retrieving the same data from a database, we need to do it from a web service? We would have to redo our entire view .
MVP makes views independent from our data source. We divide the application into at least three different layers, which let us test them independently. With MVP we are able to take most of logic out from the activities so that we can test it without using instrumentation tests.
